raw is a small and simple webgl 3d engine with simplified hybrid entity component system,its still in development and the goal is speed over accuracy, it is designed to develop games for the web which can run on desktop and mobile devices.



## Main Features:
```
Entity component system
Transform hierarchy with animation system
Extendable shader system
Phong model material system
Fast and dirty shadow mapping system
Unlimited lights system using forward rendering
Multithread dynamic terrain system
Skeletal animation system with basic inverse kinematics using FABRIK
```




## Roadmap
```
Multithreaded physics engine
Implement critical systems using web assembly
Dynamic sound system using basic sound sampler
Webvr support with positional 3d sound
Tools for world editor
```

Trying to add more features , but need to keep it simple and easy to use.
